=> JVM only unserstands byte code
=> javc coverts java code into byte code
=> extension for byte code in .class
=> JVM with libraries is part of JRE (java runtime environment)
=> we dont put ; at the end of the block
=> java supports UNICODE (have bigger range than ascii)
=> conversion is automatic conversion
=> casting is explicit conversion. ex:- float f = 4.4f; int x = (int) f;
=> == is equal to
=> != is not equal to
=> <= less than or equal to
=> >= greater than or equal to
=> A=B (right se utha ke left me store ho jayega (assignment operator))

<==Conditional Statements==>
if => alwayst check
else if => check only if is false

<==Functions==>
1.Functions requires memory (when we write fncs it takes some memory in the form of callstack), if a function is called then it takes memory in the form of call stack and after its execution when the return statement is executed it automatically deleted from the memory
2.During making of the function the paramter given parameter or formal parameter
3.When we call the function then it is arguments or actual parameter
4.Function Overloading => multiple functions with same name but differnet parameters(differentiating factor is type of parameter or no. of parameter)
5.Function overloading doesn't depend on return type
6.Method scope => can be used within the method or function
7.Block scope => can only used within the block scope (ex: i,j,k in for loop)

<==Array==>
1.we pass the array to method by reference
