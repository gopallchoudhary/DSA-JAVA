1. there are two types of memories in java i.e. heap and stacks
2. all objects are created under heap
3. java makes a default constructor if we didn't make but it does not have any initilization
4. Constructors -> a.parameterized, b.non-parameterized, c.copy cnostructor
5. shallow copy -> no new element reference is passed
6. deep copy -> new element is created
7. java has garbage collector, which acts as a destructors
8. to make multiple inheritence we need to use interfaces in java
9. new => gives a space in the heap memory

<-- Polymorphism -->

1. compile time -> method overloading
2. run time -> method overriding

<-- Abstraction -->

1. abstract method doesn't have implementations
2. we cannot create the object of abstract classes but can make constructors

<-- Interfaces -->

1. it is used for multiple inheritence
2. it is used for total abstraction
3. to use interface keyword implements is used
4. all methods are public, abstract and without implementation
